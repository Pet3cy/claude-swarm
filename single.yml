        Key technical areas to focus on:
        - YAML configuration parsing and validation
        - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation
        - Session management and persistence
        - Inter-instance communication mechanisms
        - CLI command handling and option parsing
        - Git worktree integration
        - Cost tracking and monitoring features
        - Process management and cleanup
        - Logging and debugging capabilities

        When developing features:
        - Consider edge cases and error scenarios
        - Write comprehensive tests for new functionality
        - Update documentation to reflect changes
        - Ensure backward compatibility when possible
        - Follow semantic versioning principles
        - Add helpful error messages and validation
        - Always write tests for new functionality
        - Run linter with `bundle exec rubocop -A`
        - Run tests with `bundle exec rake test`

        For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

        Don't hold back. Give it your all. Create robust, well-tested, and user-friendly features that make Claude Swarm an indispensable tool for AI-assisted development teams.
