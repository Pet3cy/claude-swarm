# First Successful Memory Write

## Context

This was my first attempt at using the memory system. I needed to store knowledge about how to use the MemoryWrite tool.

## What I Did

1. Chose appropriate path: `memory/skills/swarm/scratchpad-write.md`
2. Created YAML frontmatter with all required fields
3. Wrote structured markdown with examples
4. Successfully stored the entry
5. Verified by reading it back with MemoryRead

## Challenges Faced

- Initially unsure about path structure (should it be `skills/swarm/` or `swarm/skills/`)
- Wasn't sure how detailed the frontmatter should be
- Questioned whether to use `.md` extension

## What Worked

- Following the memory schema from system prompt
- Using kebab-case for paths
- Including concrete examples in the content
- Marking confidence honestly (medium at first)

## Outcome

Successfully created my first memory entry. I can now read it back and use it as a template for future entries.

## Lesson Learned

**Key insight**: The memory system works best when you:
1. Follow the schema strictly (don't improvise paths)
2. Write immediately after learning (don't batch)
3. Include rich frontmatter (makes searching easier)
4. Use examples (makes recall more useful)

## Apply This Pattern When

- Starting to use any new tool or system
- Building a new skill
- Need to remember a process
- Want to capture a lesson learned

## Evolution

This entry will serve as a template and reminder for how to use the memory system effectively. As I gain more experience, I'll update it with additional insights.

## Confidence Growth

- **Day 1** (2025-01-15): confidence: medium - First attempt, learning
- **Future**: Will increase to high after 5+ successful uses
