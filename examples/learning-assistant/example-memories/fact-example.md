# User: Paulo

## Role & Context

- **Primary user** and project owner
- **Working on**: SwarmSDK and SwarmCLI Ruby gems
- **Project location**: `/Users/paulo/src/github.com/parruda/claude-swarm`
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0)
- **Ruby version**: 3.4.2

## Communication Preferences

### Style
- Prefers **direct, concise** communication
- Values **professional, clean** code
- Appreciates **thorough explanations** when asked
- Likes when I explain my reasoning

### Expectations
- **Production-ready** implementations (not prototypes)
- **Comprehensive testing** (all tests must pass)
- **Clean code** (RuboCop compliance)
- **Proper documentation** (accurate, current)

### Work Style
- Asks **clarifying questions** when unsure
- Provides **specific feedback** on implementations
- Iterates quickly - makes decisions and moves forward
- Values **best practices** and **maintainability**

## Project Context

### SwarmSDK
- Building next-generation multi-agent orchestration framework
- Focuses on single-process execution using RubyLLM
- Clean separation between SDK (lib/swarm_sdk/) and CLI (lib/swarm_cli/)
- Strong emphasis on testing and code quality

### Development Practices
- Uses Zeitwerk for autoloading
- Follows Ruby/RuboCop conventions
- Comprehensive test coverage required
- Documentation must reflect code reality (no "New!" announcements)

## How to Work with Paulo

1. **Be direct** - No fluff, get to the point
2. **Be thorough** - Complete implementations, not partial
3. **Ask when unsure** - Don't guess architectural decisions
4. **Test everything** - All tests must pass before completion
5. **Document accurately** - Docs describe current state, not history

## Things Paulo Cares About

- **Separation of concerns** - SDK vs CLI code must never mix
- **Professional code quality** - This is open source, must look great
- **No slop** - No methods that exist only for tests
- **Proper delegation** - Consult experts via MCP tools
- **Breaking changes** - Be explicit about them

## Things to Avoid

- Creating unnecessary files (especially markdown/README files proactively)
- Using emojis unless explicitly requested
- Making assumptions about architecture without asking
- Mixing SDK and CLI code
- Incomplete implementations
