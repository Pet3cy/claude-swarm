      description <<~DESC
        Performs exact string replacements in files.
        You must use your Read tool at least once in the conversation before editing.
        This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
        When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix.
        The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match.
        Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.
        ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
        Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
        The edit will FAIL if old_string is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use replace_all to change every instance of old_string.
        Use replace_all for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.

        IMPORTANT - Path Handling:
        - Relative paths (e.g., "tmp/file.txt", "src/main.rb") are resolved relative to your agent's working directory
        - Absolute paths (e.g., "/tmp/file.txt", "/etc/passwd") are treated as system absolute paths
        - When the user says "tmp/file.txt" they mean the tmp directory in your working directory, NOT /tmp
        - Only use absolute paths (starting with /) when explicitly referring to system-level paths
