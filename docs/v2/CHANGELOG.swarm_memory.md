# Changelog

All notable changes to SwarmMemory will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.1]

### Added
- **250-word content limit**: MemoryWrite now validates content length
  - Enforces 250-word maximum per memory entry
  - Encourages focused, searchable entries instead of large documents
  - Helpful error message guides users to split large content into multiple linked memories
  - Promotes better organization through multiple focused entries with `related` field links

- **MemoryGlob result truncation**: Prevents overwhelming output from broad searches
  - Maximum 1000 results per query (matches Glob tool behavior)
  - System reminder added when results are truncated
  - Encourages users to use more specific patterns
  - Sorted by most recently modified (first 1000 shown)

### Changed
- **Memory Assistant prompt improvements**: Updated examples and guidance
  - Updated examples from 5000-word to 250-word entries
  - Better illustrates recommended memory organization patterns
  - Shows proper use of `related` field for linking split content

- **Memory Researcher prompt enhancements**: Comprehensive updates for better knowledge extraction
  - Clarified "learning" workflow: gather information → store thoroughly in memory
  - Added CRITICAL reminders about available memory tools (only Memory* tools, no "MemorySearch")
  - Emphasized mandatory `type` parameter in all MemoryWrite calls
  - Expanded guidance on when to create skills vs concepts/facts/experiences
  - Reinforced thoroughness: capture ALL details, don't summarize away important information
  - Better guidance on splitting large content into multiple focused, linked memories (each <250 words)
  - Clarified LoadSkill vs MemoryRead: LoadSkill for DOING tasks, MemoryRead for explaining
  - Enhanced research-specific workflows and extraction patterns
  - Improved quality standards and verification guidelines
  - Stronger emphasis on building a knowledge graph through comprehensive tagging and linking

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-27

### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE: Hierarchical directory storage**
  - Memory entries are now stored in actual directories instead of flattened paths with `--` separators
  - **Before**: `concept--ruby--classes.md` (flattened with `--` separators)
  - **After**: `concept/ruby/classes.md` (hierarchical directories)
  - **Impact**: Existing memory storage will NOT be automatically migrated
  - **Migration**: Clear existing memory or manually reorganize files into directory structure
  - **Benefits**:
    - Native Dir.glob works efficiently (no need to simulate directory semantics)
    - Glob patterns like `fact/*` now correctly match only direct children, not nested paths
    - Better filesystem semantics - paths behave like real directories
    - Improved performance for glob operations
    - More intuitive file browsing in file managers

### Added
- **Path parameter for MemoryGrep**: Limit grep searches to specific paths
  - Example: `MemoryGrep(pattern: "TODO", path: "concept/")` searches only concepts
  - Supports directory paths (`fact/api/`), subdirectories, and specific files
  - Works with all output modes (files_with_matches, content, count)
  - Directory-style filtering: `fact/api` matches `fact/api/...` but not `fact/api-design/...`

### Fixed
- **MemoryGlob path matching**: Fixed bug where single-level wildcards matched nested paths
  - `fact/*` now correctly matches only `fact/api.md`, not `fact/people/john.md`
  - `fact/**` correctly matches all nested entries recursively
  - Glob semantics now match standard filesystem glob behavior

### Added

#### Core Architecture

- **Complete Filesystem Memory System** - Real files for agent memory
  - 4 fixed categories: `concept/`, `fact/`, `skill/`, `experience/`
  - Split storage: `.md` (content), `.yml` (metadata), `.emb` (embeddings)
  - Flattened paths with `--` separator for Git-friendly structure
  - Hit tracking in metadata for archival candidate detection
  - Stubs and redirects for merged/moved entries (`# merged →`, `# moved →`)

- **Plugin System Integration** - SwarmMemory integrates with SwarmSDK via plugin architecture
  - `SwarmMemory::Integration::SDKPlugin` implements `SwarmSDK::Plugin` interface
  - Auto-registers with SwarmSDK when loaded via `require "swarm_memory"`
  - Provides tools, storage, and system prompt contributions
  - Zero coupling: SwarmSDK works standalone without SwarmMemory
  - Lifecycle hooks: `on_agent_initialized`, `on_swarm_started`, `on_user_message`

- **Adapter Plugin Registry** - Pluggable storage backends
  - `SwarmMemory::Adapters::Base.register_adapter()` for custom adapters
  - Third-party gems can register custom storage implementations
  - Adapter pattern decouples storage from interface
  - Current implementation: `FilesystemAdapter` (real .md/.yml/.emb files)

#### Memory Modes System

- **Three Operational Modes** - Mode-specific prompts and tools
  - **Retrieval Mode** - Read-only (MemoryRead, MemoryGlob, MemoryGrep)
    - 88-line prompt focused on search strategies
    - Q&A agents accessing knowledge without modification
  - **Assistant Mode** - Read + Write + Edit + LoadSkill
    - 139-line prompt with writing guidelines and quality standards
    - Learning assistants that correct/update knowledge
    - Dynamic tool adaptation via LoadSkill
  - **Researcher Mode** - Full access (all 9 tools)
    - 201-line prompt with optimization strategies
    - Knowledge extraction, deep optimization, graph building
    - Includes MemoryMultiEdit, MemoryDelete, MemoryDefrag
  - Configure via `memory.mode` in agent config

#### Semantic Search

  - Pure semantic mode for relationship detection (no keyword pollution)
  - Works with any storage adapter

- **Adaptive Discovery Thresholds** - Query-length based thresholds
  - Short queries (< 10 words): Lower threshold (0.25 default) for broader matching
  - Normal queries (≥ 10 words): Higher threshold (0.35 default) for precision
  - Configurable via environment variables:
    - `SWARM_MEMORY_DISCOVERY_THRESHOLD` (normal queries)
    - `SWARM_MEMORY_DISCOVERY_THRESHOLD_SHORT` (short queries)
    - `SWARM_MEMORY_ADAPTIVE_WORD_CUTOFF` (word count cutoff)

- **Improved Embeddings** - Optimized for search
  - Embeds title (highest weight) + tags + domain + first paragraph

### Removed

- **Old Registration System** - Replaced by plugin
  - `Tools::Registry.register_extension()` calls removed
  - Now uses `SwarmSDK::PluginRegistry.register()`

### Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Major breaking changes:**

1. **Plugin-based integration required**
   - SwarmMemory MUST be loaded after SwarmSDK
   - Auto-registration happens on require
   - No manual registration needed

2. **Embeddings enabled by default**
   - Storage now creates embeddings for all entries
   - Requires Informers gem for semantic search
   - `.emb` files created alongside `.md` and `.yml` files
   - Run `swarm memory setup` to download model (~90MB)

3. **Memory prompt location changed**
   - **Was**: Hardcoded path in SwarmSDK
   - **Now**: Plugin provides prompt via `system_prompt_contribution()`

4. **Memory modes required**
   - Must specify mode: retrieval | assistant | researcher
   - Different tools available per mode
   - Mode-specific prompts loaded dynamically

5. **MemoryWrite requires 8 parameters**
   - All parameters mandatory (no defaults)
   - file_path, content, title, type, confidence, tags, related, domain
   - Enforces metadata discipline

6. **MemoryEdit requires read-before-edit**
   - Must call MemoryRead before MemoryEdit
   - Tracked globally via StorageReadTracker
   - Error if attempting to edit unread file
