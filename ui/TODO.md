## üìù Notes

The current implementation provides a comprehensive swarm management system with **full execution capabilities** and nearly complete core functionality. The primary remaining gap is **connection management**.

### Current State
- ‚úÖ **Visualization**: Excellent visual representation of swarms with auto-layout
- ‚úÖ **Agent management**: Full CRUD operations for agents and templates
- ‚úÖ **User experience**: Professional, responsive design with modal workflows
- ‚úÖ **Persistence**: All changes are automatically saved to YAML files with state tracking
- ‚úÖ **Configuration**: Complete MCP and tool configuration support with restrictions
- ‚úÖ **Execution**: Full swarm execution with real Claude-swarm CLI integration
- ‚úÖ **Runtime monitoring**: Real-time terminal output, process stats, and interactive input
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Connection management**: Cannot create/delete connections between agents (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### Recent Major Achievements
- **Runtime Execution System**: Complete interactive terminal with real Claude-swarm CLI execution
- **Process Monitoring**: Real CPU/memory stats via system commands
- **Interactive Terminal**: Full command input with help system and session management  
- **Error Handling**: Proper exit code handling (null codes treated as clean exits)
- **YAML Compatibility**: Support for both old and new YAML structure formats
- **Clean Architecture**: Resolved all TypeScript errors and deprecated warnings

### Next Steps
The **highest priority** is implementing **connection management** (drag to create connections, UI to delete connections) as this is the only major missing piece for a complete swarm orchestration system. After that, focus should shift to polish features like configuration validation and enhanced UX.
