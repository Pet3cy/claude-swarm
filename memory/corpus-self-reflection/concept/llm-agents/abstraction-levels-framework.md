Agents should use different abstraction levels based on their knowledge state and task requirements. This is a learning progression, not a static architecture.

## The Three Abstraction Levels

**Level 1: Filesystem (Discovery)**
- Used when: Agent encounters unknown data structures
- Characteristics: High discoverability, low efficiency, familiar semantics
- Agent capability: Learning what data exists and how it's organized
- Example: `ls /users/`, `cat /users/alice.json` to understand user data structure

**Level 2: Filesystem (Known Structure)**
- Used when: Agent knows the structure but operations are simple
- Characteristics: Moderate efficiency, familiar semantics, predictable behavior
- Agent capability: Can navigate known hierarchies efficiently
- Example: `cat /users/alice.json` when agent already knows the structure

**Level 3: Specialized Tools (Complex Operations)**
- Used when: Agent knows the structure AND needs efficient complex operations
- Characteristics: High efficiency, requires learning, expressive power
- Agent capability: Can formulate complex queries and understand specialized semantics
- Example: `query_database("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30")` after understanding the schema

## Key Insight

The filesystem is not the destinationâ€”it's the entry point. Agents should graduate to specialized tools once they understand the data structure and recognize that filesystem operations are becoming inefficient.
