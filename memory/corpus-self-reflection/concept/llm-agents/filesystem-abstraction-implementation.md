Implementing filesystem abstraction for LLM agents requires careful design of how different data sources map to filesystem hierarchies.

## Mapping Strategies

**Databases as Directories**: Map database tables to directories, rows to files, columns to file content or metadata. Example: `/databases/users/user_123.json` contains user data with all columns as JSON fields.

**APIs as File Paths**: Map API endpoints to file hierarchies. Example: `/api/github/repos/owner/repo/issues/123` maps to fetching a specific GitHub issue. Query parameters become path segments or file metadata.

**Structured Data as Files**: Expose JSON, YAML, or CSV data as readable files. The filesystem layer handles serialization/deserialization transparently.

**Real-time Data as Virtual Files**: Files that compute their content on read. Example: `/system/metrics/cpu_usage` returns current CPU usage when read, `/weather/current` returns live weather data.

**Search Results as Listings**: Query results appear as directory listings. Example: `/search/users?name=john` returns matching users as files in that directory.

**Hierarchical Organization**: Use directory depth to represent data relationships. Example: `/organizations/acme/teams/engineering/members/alice` clearly shows organizational hierarchy.

## Design Considerations

**Path Semantics**: Design paths that clearly represent data relationships. Avoid ambiguous hierarchies that confuse agents.

**Metadata Exposure**: Use file metadata (size, modification time, permissions) to expose additional information about data.

**Performance**: Virtual filesystem operations should be efficient. Lazy loading and caching are critical for scalability.

**Consistency**: Ensure operations behave predictably. Agents must be able to reason about what will happen.

**Error Clarity**: Map underlying errors to filesystem concepts. Database constraint violations might become "permission denied" or "file exists."
