Agents should evolve through distinct phases as they work with data, moving from discovery to optimization.

## The Four Phases

**Phase 1: Bootstrap** - Encounter new data → Use filesystem to explore structure and understand what exists

**Phase 2: Understanding** - Discover structure → Continue using filesystem for simple operations while building mental model

**Phase 3: Optimization** - Recognize inefficiency → Learn and switch to specialized tools for complex operations

**Phase 4: Mastery** - Use specialized tools for complex operations, filesystem for exploration of new data sources

## Why This Progression Matters

Each phase has different requirements:
- Bootstrap needs discoverability (filesystem excels)
- Understanding needs familiarity (filesystem is familiar)
- Optimization needs efficiency (specialized tools excel)
- Mastery needs flexibility (use right tool for each task)

Agents that get stuck in Phase 2 continue using inefficient filesystem operations when better tools are available. The architecture should help agents recognize when to transition to the next phase.
