While powerful, the filesystem abstraction pattern has important limitations and trade-offs to consider:

## Limitations

**Impedance Mismatch**: Some data sources don't map cleanly to filesystem hierarchies. Complex relational queries, graph traversals, or multi-dimensional data can be awkward to express as paths. A query like "find all users who purchased products in category X in the last 30 days" might require multiple filesystem operations.

**Performance Overhead**: The abstraction layer adds latency compared to direct access. Each filesystem operation may translate to multiple underlying operations. Caching and optimization are essential.

**Expressiveness**: Filesystem operations are simpler than specialized query languages. Complex filtering, aggregation, or transformation might require multiple operations or become inefficient.

**Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across distributed data sources through a filesystem abstraction is challenging. Transactions spanning multiple sources are difficult to implement.

**Scalability Limits**: Very large datasets may not perform well when exposed as filesystem hierarchies. Listing millions of files is inefficient.

## When NOT to Use This Pattern

✗ Highly specialized query patterns required
✗ Performance is critical and overhead unacceptable
✗ Data doesn't naturally hierarchize
✗ Real-time consistency across sources is essential
✗ Complex transactions spanning multiple sources
✗ Very large datasets requiring efficient querying

## Hybrid Approach

Often the best solution combines filesystem abstraction with specialized tools. Use filesystem abstraction for exploration and simple access, but provide specialized tools for complex queries or performance-critical operations. Agents can choose the right tool for each task.
