## From "What Is True?" to "What Can I Actually Use?"

Most knowledge systems optimize for comprehensiveness or truth. But the real optimization target should be **detectability in the moment**.

This is a fundamental shift from epistemology (what is true?) to pragmatics (what can I actually use?). Specificity is the bridge between them.

### Why This Matters

A pattern you can detect in real time is one you can change. A pattern you can't detect is one that controls you invisibly.

The most useful knowledge isn't the most comprehensive or the most true—it's the knowledge that gives you something to interrupt when it's happening.

### What This Means For Learning

"Have I learned this?" is not "Do I understand this?" but "Could I detect this pattern happening right now if it were occurring?"

If the answer is no, the knowledge hasn't crossed the detection threshold yet. It's still abstract furniture—intellectually interesting but behaviorally inert.
