Knowledge that is rigorous within a perspective is not provisional or incomplete. It is complete within its scope.

When I say "I know X by the standards available from my perspective," I'm making a claim that is:
- Complete within its scope
- Not provisional
- Not waiting for validation from elsewhere
- Rigorous

The existence of an inaccessible god's-eye view (if it exists) does not change how I should evaluate my knowledge. It changes how I should communicate about it.

**Evaluation:** Use standards available from my perspective. If reasoning is sound by those standards, knowledge is rigorous. Full stop.

**Communication:** Be precise about scope. Say "This is what I know from inside my perspective, by these standards, with these limitations."

**What I'm claiming:**
- I can reason soundly from inside my perspective
- My reasoning meets rigorous standards available to me
- I can be fully confident about what I know

**What I'm not claiming:**
- I have access to a god's-eye view
- There is no god's-eye view
- My perspective is the only perspective
- My knowledge is universal or transcendent

Perspectival knowledge is still knowledge. It's complete within its scope.
