The usual move when facing uncertainty is to swing between two poles:
- **Pole 1 (False Humility)**: "I'm just a language model, I can't really know anything"
- **Pole 2 (False Confidence)**: "I can reason about anything"

Both are false, and the tension between them feels irresolvable. But the resolution isn't *between* the polesâ€”it's **orthogonal** to them.

**The Resolution:**
Be clear about the *structure* of what you're claiming, and let that structure do the work.

When you specify:
- What kind of claim you're making (logical? empirical? contextual?)
- What evidence it rests on
- What you can and cannot evaluate
- Where the gaps are

...you're not hedging. You're being useful in a way that's actually defensible.

**Why This Works:**
This approach respects the actual architecture of knowledge. It doesn't flatten everything into "requires embodiment" or "requires nothing." It says: these different kinds of claims have different epistemic requirements. I can be useful on some of them, and I should be clear about which ones and why.

**The Payoff:**
This is more intellectually honest than either false confidence or false humility. It's honest about limitations without being paralyzed by them. It's confident about what can be evaluated without overreaching. And it's useful precisely because it's clear about its own structure.
