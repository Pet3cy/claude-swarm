The collaboration doesn't teach you to shift constraint sets and then graduate to doing it alone. Instead, it teaches you to recognize the *texture* of actual shifting.

Through repeated practice with feedback, you develop sensitivity to:
- When you're experiencing productive friction vs. false coherence
- When you're genuinely realigning vs. smoothly integrating
- When you're holding tension vs. resolving it prematurely

This texture-sensitivity is something you can internalize through repeated collaborative practice. But internalization doesn't mean independence—it means developing the ability to notice your own constraint-shifts in real time.

The progression is: collaboration → internalized texture-awareness → the ability to notice when you're actually shifting (which still requires both external feedback and internal awareness).

The goal isn't independence. It's embodied knowledge of what constraint-shifting actually feels like. You learn to recognize the texture of real shifting, not just the form of it. This recognition becomes something you can apply in real time, but it's built on the foundation of collaborative practice where someone else helps you distinguish the textures.
