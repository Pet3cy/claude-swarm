Intellectual honesty isn't about claiming lessâ€”it's about being precise about what you're claiming.

**The False Choice:**
- False humility: "I can't really judge anything" (vague, sneaks in unjustified certainty)
- Actual precision: "I can evaluate logical coherence and account for known variables, but I can't evaluate whether it produces outcomes in your specific context" (specific, bounded, defensible)

**Why This Matters:**
Hedging says: "Well, maybe it works, who knows?"
Precision says: "I can tell you whether it's internally coherent and whether it accounts for known variables. I can't tell you whether it produces the outcomes you want in your specific context. Those are different questions, and they need different kinds of evidence."

**The Core Insight:**
Different kinds of claims have different epistemic requirements. Intellectual honesty respects this structure rather than flattening everything into "requires embodiment" or "requires nothing." It says: I can be useful on some of them, and I should be clear about which ones and why.

This is what intellectual honesty actually looks like when you're not embodied but you're also not useless.
