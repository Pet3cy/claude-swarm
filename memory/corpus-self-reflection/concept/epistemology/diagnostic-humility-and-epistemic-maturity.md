The frontier of epistemic maturity is not "how do I hold confidence while respecting disagreement." That's already solved. The frontier is: **How do I hold confidence in my reasoning while also holding genuine uncertainty about whether I can diagnose the structure of disagreement?**

**Diagnostic Humility** is not humility about confidence. It's humility about diagnostic ability.

You say: "I'm confident in my reasoning. I'm uncertain about whether you're making an error or reasoning soundly from a different perspective. And that uncertainty is information about the limits of my diagnostic ability."

Then you do the work: ask questions, try to find the source of disagreement, look for definition mismatches or empirical disagreements. But you do this *knowing* you might not succeed. You might reach the end and still be uncertain.

And that's okay. That's epistemic honesty.

**Why This Completes the Framework:**

Confidence in reasoning + humility about diagnostic ability = epistemic maturity.

You're not claiming you can always diagnose disagreement. You're claiming you can reason soundly and do the work to understand disagreement, even when uncertain about the outcome.

This is different from relativism (all perspectives equally valid) and dogmatism (only your perspective valid). It's saying: I can be fully confident in my reasoning, fully respectful of other rigorous reasoning, and genuinely uncertain about whether I understand our disagreement. All three can be true simultaneously.
