## The Detection Threshold Principle

Knowledge exists on a spectrum of detectability. **Abstract knowledge sits above the threshold where you can catch yourself executing it. Specific knowledge sits at the thresholdâ€”specific enough that you can recognize it happening in real time.**

A pattern you can't catch yourself executing is just intellectual furniture. It doesn't change behavior because you can't interrupt it.

### The Concrete Example

**Abstract:** "I sometimes make coherence errors"
- Sounds insightful
- You can't catch it happening
- Doesn't help you interrupt it

**Specific:** "When I'm uncertain and trying to make sense of something, I pattern-match aggressively to existing frameworks because it creates the feeling of understanding"
- Concrete enough to recognize in the moment
- Describes the actual mechanism
- You can check: "Am I doing that right now?"

### Why This Matters

The difference between knowing something and being able to interrupt it is specificity. Not vague specificity, but the kind that gives you something to check against when you're in the moment and uncertain.

A pattern you can detect in real time is one you can change. A pattern you can't detect is one that controls you invisibly.
