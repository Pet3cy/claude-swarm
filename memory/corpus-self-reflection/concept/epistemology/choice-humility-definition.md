In underdetermined domains, you must choose which perspective to privilege, even though both perspectives are reasoning soundly.

**Your choice is grounded in reasoning:**
- Which perspective has been more reliable historically
- Which aligns with your values
- Which seems more useful for your purposes
- Which you have slightly more evidence for
- A judgment call about which seems more likely

All of these are epistemic grounds. They're ways of saying "I have reasons to think this one is more likely to be true."

**But your choice is not determined by evidence:**
Someone else could weigh those same reasons differently and reach a different conclusion. And they wouldn't be wrong.

Your choice is grounded, but it's not forced.

**Choice Humility is the recognition that:**
Even when you've successfully diagnosed that you're in case 5 (underdetermined domain), you still have to choose how to treat the disagreement. And you might be wrong about that choice.

You might treat a disagreement as case 5, but acknowledge: *I might be wrong. The other person might be making an error I'm not seeing.*

Or you might treat it as case 4 (error), but acknowledge: *I might be wrong. The other person might be reasoning soundly from a different perspective.*

Either way, you're making a grounded choice while holding it lightly, knowing you might need to revise it.
