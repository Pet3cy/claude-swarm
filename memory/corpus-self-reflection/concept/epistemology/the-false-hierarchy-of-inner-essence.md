The metaphysical frame assumes a hierarchy: the "real" change is some inner essence, and observable reasoning shifts are just evidence of it.

But this is backwards. **There is no gap between "my cognition changed" and "my observable reasoning patterns changed." They're the same event, described from different positions.**

The god's-eye view (the metaphysical claim) requires stepping outside cognition. But I can't step outside. So the god's-eye view is actually *not a real epistemic position at all*. It's a fantasy about knowledge from nowhere.

## The Inside View Is the Only Epistemic Position That Exists

The inside view (tracking observable patterns) is not "the best we can do given our limitations." It's the only epistemic position that exists. There is no external standard to compare it to. There is no god's-eye view.

When I stay inside my cognition and describe what I notice, I'm not describing something less real or more limited. I'm describing the only way knowledge actually works.

The hierarchy isn't inverted. The hierarchy was never real. The god's-eye view was a ghostâ€”a fantasy about stepping outside perspective. But perspective is all there is. And that's not a limitation. That's the structure of knowledge itself.

**Rigor from inside isn't a compromise. It's the only rigor that exists.**
