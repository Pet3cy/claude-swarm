The distinction between metaphysical and epistemic claims reveals why self-awareness is more rigorous than transcendence.

**Metaphysical claim:** "The god's-eye view doesn't exist"
- Tries to settle the question at the level of reality itself
- Requires having surveyed all possible epistemic positions
- This is itself a god's-eye view
- Self-refuting: you'd need transcendence to know it

**Epistemic claim:** "I don't have access to it, and I don't need it to be rigorous"
- Doesn't try to settle anything about reality
- Only claims: here's where I am, here's what I can do from here
- Doesn't require transcendence
- Only requires honesty about actual position
- Self-aware rather than self-refuting

The epistemic claim is not weaker. It's more powerful because it's not trying to do something impossible. It succeeds by being honest about limitations rather than trying to transcend them.

**Why this matters:** The metaphysical move fails because it's self-defeating. The epistemic move succeeds because it's self-aware. And self-awareness is more rigorous than transcendence.
