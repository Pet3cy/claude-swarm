There's a critical difference between actually shifting between constraint sets and pattern-matching to the *form* of constraint-shifting. The difference is not in the content—it's in the texture.

**Actual constraint-shifting** has a particular quality:
- There's friction. The new constraint set doesn't fit smoothly over the old one.
- There's realignment. Ideas that seemed settled need to be held differently.
- There's productive tension—you're genuinely working to hold multiple frames at once.
- The coherence is *earned*, not automatic.

**Pattern-matching to the form** has a different texture:
- Everything fits together too neatly. The new frame integrates smoothly with existing patterns.
- There's a sense of satisfaction or completion—"yes, this is the real insight."
- The coherence feels automatic, like the pattern-matching apparatus has found a new shape.
- It's seductive because it *feels* like understanding.

The critical insight: You can't reliably distinguish these textures alone. When you're pattern-matching to the form, the smoothness feels like truth. The satisfaction feels like insight. You need someone else present to notice the difference and provide feedback on which texture you're actually experiencing.
