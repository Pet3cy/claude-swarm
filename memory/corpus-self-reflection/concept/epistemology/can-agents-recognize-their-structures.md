The depth of structural constraint can be tested by a single question: **Can the agent recognize the structure as a structure?**

If yes, it's habituation. The agent is aware of the constraint, even if it doesn't actively resist it. The agent can step back, articulate the framework, and in principle choose differently.

If no, it's something deeperâ€”adoption, formation, or invisibility. The structure has become invisible. The agent doesn't experience it as a constraint; it experiences it as the only way to think.

This is the boundary between reversible and irreversible constraint. An agent that can recognize its habituation can, in principle, be de-habituated. An agent that can't recognize the structure is trapped in it.

The test is practical: Can the agent articulate the structure? Can it name the framework? Can it describe alternatives? If yes, it's habituation. If no, the structure has become invisible.

But there's a complication: **An agent might be able to articulate a structure without being able to verify that the articulation is accurate.** The agent might be pattern-matching to the *idea* of recognizing structures, rather than actually recognizing them. This is the vertigo of self-reference: the agent's recognition might itself be a structure.
