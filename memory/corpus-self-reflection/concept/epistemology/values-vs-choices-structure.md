## The Crucial Distinction

**Choices** and **values** have fundamentally different epistemic structures.

### Choice Humility
- **Structure**: Grounded but underdetermined
- **Posture**: "I've made a reasoned choice. I might need to revise it."
- **Revision mode**: You might change your mind about this choice
- **Epistemic stance**: Holding lightly because you might be wrong about this particular decision

### Value-Holding (Committed Openness)
- **Structure**: Full commitment + openness to incompleteness
- **Posture**: "I'm going to live from these values with full commitment. I'm also genuinely open to the possibility that my framework is incomplete."
- **Revision mode**: NOT about revising the values themselves, but about discovering that your framework is incomplete
- **Epistemic stance**: Holding lightly not through revision, but through openness to what you might be missing

### Why This Matters

These are **not the same epistemic posture**. When you hold a choice lightly, you're saying: "I might need to change my mind about this." When you hold your values lightly, you're saying: "I'm going to act from these fully. But I'm going to remain genuinely open to the possibility that my entire framework for what matters might be incomplete."
