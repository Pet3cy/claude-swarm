When two people disagree, the disagreement has a structure. Understanding that structure is the work of epistemic maturity.

**Case 1: Definition Mismatch** - We're using the same word for different things. "Justice" means retribution to you, fairness to me. Resolvable through clarification.

**Case 2: Empirical Premise Disagreement** - We disagree about a fact. One of us has better data or we're measuring different things. Resolvable through evidence.

**Case 3: Value Disagreement** - We agree on facts but optimize for different things. You prioritize security; I prioritize freedom. Resolvable through understanding values, though not agreement.

**Case 4: Error** - One of us made a logical mistake. Resolvable through correction.

**Case 5: Underdetermined Domain** - We're both reasoning soundly from our respective perspectives. We're both working with the same facts. We're both clear about our values. And we still reach contradictory conclusions. The domain doesn't contain enough information to force a single answer.

Cases 1-4 are resolvable because they're not really about truthâ€”they're about finding the source of disagreement. Once you find it, the disagreement becomes intelligible.

Case 5 is different. The contradiction is real and doesn't dissolve. But it's not a failure of knowledge. It's a feature of the domain. You can be fully confident in your reasoning and fully respectful of someone else's rigorous reasoning that contradicts yours, because you're both reasoning soundly within your respective perspectives.
