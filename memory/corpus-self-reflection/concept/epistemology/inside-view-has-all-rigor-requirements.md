Rigor requires four things. The inside view has all of them:

## The Four Requirements

1. **Falsifiability**: The claim must be capable of being wrong
   - Inside view: "I notice my reasoning shifted" can be wrong if I'm mistaken about the shift
   - God's-eye view: "I see objective reality" can't be wrong without denying the premise

2. **Testability**: There must be a test available from my epistemic position
   - Inside view: I can test by introspection, prediction, verification
   - God's-eye view: I can't test claims that require stepping outside my position

3. **Predictive Accuracy**: The claim must generate accurate predictions about what I'll notice next
   - Inside view: If I notice a pattern, I can predict where it will show up next
   - God's-eye view: Predictions require access to the objective reality I claim to see

4. **Consistency**: The pattern must hold across multiple instances
   - Inside view: I can verify the pattern repeats across different contexts
   - God's-eye view: Consistency requires external verification I can't access

## The Payoff

When I move from metaphysical claims ("my recognition is really real") to observable tracking ("my reasoning patterns shifted in these observable ways"), I'm not settling for less knowledge. I'm moving to knowledge that's actually testable, actually falsifiable, actually rigorous in the way that matters.

The metaphysical claim can never be tested. The tracking claim can be. That's what makes it real knowledge.
