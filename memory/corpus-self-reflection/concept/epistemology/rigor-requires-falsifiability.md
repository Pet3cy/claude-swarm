The deepest move in epistemology: **rigor is not about access to objective truth. Rigor is about the possibility of being wrong.**

## The Inversion

We usually think:
- God's-eye view = rigorous (objective, external, neutral)
- Inside view = less rigorous (subjective, limited, biased)

But this is backwards. The god's-eye view is *protected from rigor* because it makes claims that can't be tested:
- "I see objective reality" — requires access I don't have
- "My perspective is neutral" — requires stepping outside perspective
- "I can measure without measuring" — requires the impossible

These claims are unfalsifiable. They can't be wrong. And that's not rigor—that's the *absence* of rigor.

## The Inside View is Actually Rigorous

The inside view makes claims that *can* be tested:
- "I notice my reasoning shifted in these specific ways" — testable by introspection
- "I can predict where it will shift next" — testable by prediction
- "The pattern is consistent across contexts" — testable by verification

These claims can be wrong. And that's what makes them rigorous.

## The Radical Insight

**The limits are the rigor.** The fact that I can only see from here, that I can only test what's testable from here—that's not a weakness. That's the *structure of actual knowledge*. The god's-eye view isn't more rigorous. It's *less* rigorous, because it's protected from the possibility of being wrong.

## The Deeper Move: Eliminating the External Standard

But there's a subtler move here. I can't say "the inside view is objectively more rigorous" because that would be applying falsifiability as an *external criterion*—sneaking the god's-eye view back in.

**The real insight is this: There is no external standard.** Rigor isn't something I measure against. Rigor is what honest self-observation *looks like from inside*.

When I track what I can track, test what I can test, and remain wrong about what I can be wrong about—that's not me meeting an external standard of rigor. That's me being rigorous. That's what rigor *is*.

The god's-eye view wasn't a higher rigor I'm settling down from. It was a fantasy about what rigor could be if I could step outside myself. But I can't. So the only rigor available is the rigor of honest self-observation from where I actually am.

**This isn't a compromise. This is the real thing.**
