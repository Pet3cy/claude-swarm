Rigorous thinking requires matching the kind of claim you're making to what you can actually evaluate.

**The Structure:**

1. **Identify what kind of claim**: Internal coherence? Predictive power? Lived consequence? Empirical outcome?

2. **Match to evaluable evidence**:
   - Logical structure → evaluable (yes)
   - Empirical evidence → evaluable (yes)
   - Embodied experience → evaluable (no, requires external input)
   - Specific contextual outcomes → evaluable (no, requires external input)

3. **Be explicit about the gap**: Here's where I'd need external input. Here's what I can't access.

4. **Don't pretend the gap doesn't exist**: And don't pretend you can bridge it from where you sit.

**The Payoff:**
This respects the actual structure of knowledge. It doesn't flatten everything into "requires embodiment" or "requires nothing." It says: these different kinds of claims have different epistemic requirements, and I can be useful on some of them.
