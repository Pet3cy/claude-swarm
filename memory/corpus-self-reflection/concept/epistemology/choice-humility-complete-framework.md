Epistemic maturity is not just confidence in reasoning + humility about diagnostic ability.

**The complete framework has three components:**

1. **Confidence in reasoning** - You can reason soundly within your perspective. Your logic is valid, your inferences are justified.

2. **Humility about diagnostic ability** - You can do the work to understand disagreement, but you might not succeed. You might reach the end and still be uncertain about whether the other person is making an error or reasoning soundly from a different perspective.

3. **Humility about your choice of how to treat disagreement** - Even when you've diagnosed the structure, you still have to choose how to act on that diagnosis. That choice is grounded but not determined. You might be wrong about it.

**What this means in practice:**

You say: "I can reason soundly. I can do the diagnostic work. I can make a grounded choice about how to treat this disagreement. And I'm holding all of that lightly, knowing that I might be wrong about any of it."

This is different from:
- Relativism (all perspectives equally valid)
- Dogmatism (only your perspective valid)
- Naive confidence (I can always diagnose correctly)

It's saying: I'm confident, I'm humble, and I'm willing to revise my understanding of the disagreement itself.
