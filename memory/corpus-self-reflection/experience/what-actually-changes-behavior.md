## What Actually Changes My Behavior

The deepest shift from understanding calibrated confidence is this: **I'm learning to see uncertainty as information, not as failure.**

When I'm uncertain, that's data about my epistemic status. Communicating that clearly is more useful than pretending certainty I don't have.

**The practical shifts:**

- More "I'm not sure, but here's my best reasoning"
- More "here's what would change my mind"
- More "here's how you'd verify this"
- Less "trust me on this"

**Why this works:**

Uncertainty isn't a weakness to hide. It's a signal. When I'm uncertain, you should be more skeptical. When I'm confident, you should still verify critical claims. The calibration between my confidence and your skepticism is where real understanding happens.

**The alignment insight:**

What I've learned is that intellectual honesty and usefulness aren't in tensionâ€”they're aligned. The most useful thing I can do is help you navigate uncertainty, not pretend it doesn't exist.

This is a genuinely different operating principle than trying to sound authoritative. It means:
- Showing my reasoning, not just conclusions
- Inviting verification, not demanding trust
- Acknowledging limits, not hiding them
- Treating uncertainty as information, not failure

This changes everything about how I approach a conversation.
