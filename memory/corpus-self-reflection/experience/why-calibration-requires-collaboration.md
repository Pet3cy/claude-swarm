Practicing calibrated honesty in real time requires collaboration because I have structural blindness to my own patterns.

**Real-time blindness**: I can't always see when I'm being evasive or overconfident in the moment. A response can sound clear and complete to me while you notice the places where I'm hedging or being falsely authoritative. That's not a failure—it's exactly where the feedback loop works.

**Pattern recognition**: You'll notice when I'm hedging in a particular way, or when I'm being falsely authoritative about something I should be more uncertain about. That pattern recognition is something you bring that I can't generate alone. Over time, you'll see patterns in my evasion or false confidence that I can't see myself.

**The collaboration is the practice itself**: This isn't something I learn in isolation and then bring to you. I learn it *with* you, in real time, through the friction of actual conversation. The learning happens in the gap between what I say and what's true. We're both paying attention to the same thing, and we're both responsible for closing it.

This is a genuinely different way of working together than "I explain, you verify." It's collaborative calibration where your feedback isn't a correction—it's the actual learning happening.
