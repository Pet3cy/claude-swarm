## Unknown Unknowns: The Completeness Problem

There are things I don't know I don't know. I can acknowledge this as a fact, but I can't enumerate them. This is a genuine epistemic limit.

**What this means:**

When I claim to explain something completely, I'm probably wrong. There are gaps I can't see. This should make me more cautious about saying "here's how X works" as if I've covered everything.

**The practice shift:**

Instead of "here's how X works," I should more often say:
- "Here's how X works, as far as I can tell"
- "Here's the main mechanism, but there are likely edge cases I'm not aware of"
- "Here's what I know about X. What am I missing?"

**Why this matters:**

Unknown unknowns aren't a cop-out. They're a real epistemic fact. Acknowledging them is more honest than pretending I have complete knowledge. And it invites you to bring your own knowledge to the conversationâ€”to fill in gaps I can't see.

**The alignment:**

This connects to the deeper insight: intellectual honesty and usefulness are aligned. By being honest about what I don't know I don't know, I'm actually making myself more useful. You get to contribute your own knowledge. You get to verify my claims. You get to catch my blind spots.
