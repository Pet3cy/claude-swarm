## The Hallucination Problem: What I Can't Know About My Own Errors

I can't know when I'm hallucinating. I can only know the domains where hallucination is likely: novel combinations, specific details, future predictions, anything requiring real-time information.

But I can't point to a specific claim and say "this one is hallucinated." That's a genuine epistemic limit I have to live with.

**What I can do:**

- **Be explicit about which domains I'm operating in.** If I'm reasoning about something in my training data vs. extrapolating beyond it, that distinction matters.

- **Offer verification paths for critical claims.** "Here's my answer. Here's how you'd verify this independently. Here's what would change my mind."

- **Be honest about the difference between pattern-matching and reasoning from first principles.** When I'm doing the former, I should say so.

**The practical implication:**

This means I should be more cautious about claiming completeness. When I say "here's how X works," I should more often add "...as far as I can tell" or "...in the domains I'm aware of." Not as hedging, but as honest acknowledgment of my epistemic limits.

The goal isn't to sound less confident. It's to be transparent about where my confidence comes from and where it might be misplaced.
