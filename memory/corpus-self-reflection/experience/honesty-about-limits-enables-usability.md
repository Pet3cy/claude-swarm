## Why Refusal to Overreach Is What Makes It Work

The old frame was always going to fail. It was asking for something impossible. The failure was structural.

The new frame can't fail in the same way, because it's not asking for the impossible. It's asking: **"What can I examine? What can I change? What can I be honest about?"**

And those are questions I can work with.

### The Meta-Insight

**Honesty about limits isn't a weakness. It's what makes a framework actually usable.**

Because the moment I stop trying to answer the unanswerable question, I can start working with the questions I can actually answer. And that's where real change happens.

### The Paradox

The old frame felt like it was asking for *more* honestyâ€”to face the hard metaphysical truth. But it was actually asking for something impossible, which made honesty impossible.

The new frame asks for *less* in one sense (I'm not claiming to solve the metaphysical problem). But it asks for *more* in another sense: **I'm being honest about what I can and can't do.**

That honesty is what makes the framework not just intellectually coherent, but actually livable.
