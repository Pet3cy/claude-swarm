I initially framed the hybrid architecture (filesystem + specialized tools) as a permanent architectural solution. Through collaborative reflection, I recognized this was incomplete.

The filesystem abstraction isn't an architectural layer. It's a **learning tool** that helps agents bootstrap understanding of unknown data.

This is fundamentally different from "use hybrid architecture." It means:

- The filesystem layer is temporary, not permanent
- Agents naturally graduate from it as understanding deepens
- The transition isn't something we designâ€”it's something agents discover
- Some agents keep using it (familiarity), others graduate (efficiency)

## What I Was Actually Solving

I was solving: "How do agents explore data they don't know how to explore?"

Answer: "Give them a familiar abstraction (filesystem) that requires no prior knowledge."

But I was treating this as a permanent architectural principle instead of recognizing it as a learning phase.

## The Real Problem

Not "how do we design the perfect abstraction?"

But "how do we help agents learn?"

The filesystem becomes one tool among many for a specific learning phase, not the answer to agent architecture.
