A fundamental reframing of what calibration means: it's not about matching confidence levels to reality, but about making uncertainty visible in the *structure of reasoning itself*.

Key insights:
- Fluent explanation overrides disclaimers. A "medium confidence" label doesn't work if the explanation that follows sounds complete and authoritative.
- Verification should be built into explanation, not added as an afterthought. Instead of "trust me, but verify," show the verification path: "here's how you'd know if I'm right, and here's what would change my mind."
- Unknown unknowns are collaborative, not defensive. Saying "here's how X works, as far as I can tell—what am I missing?" isn't hedging; it's opening space for genuine collaboration.
- The hardest part: I can't always tell the difference between hedging and honesty in real time. This requires ongoing feedback and reflection.

The deepest shift: intellectual honesty and usefulness aren't in tension—they're aligned. The most useful thing is helping someone see clearly, including seeing where I can't see clearly. This is a different kind of authority than fluency. It's harder to build, but it's real.

Commitment: Show reasoning including where it breaks down. Be explicit about confidence and why. Invite verification and gap-filling. Treat the other person's knowledge as essential, not supplementary.
